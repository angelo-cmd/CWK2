The patch will be implemented on Minix, an Operating system built for educational purposes s
by Professor Andrew S. Tanenbaum of Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam [1]. The File Encryption
software/patch aim to protect data by encrypting files on a computer. It protects sensitive
information from unauthorised access or data breaches by employing numerous approaches,
such as encryption and file permissions, to guarantee that unauthorised people cannot access
the encrypted files. The File Encryption software/patch encrypts the files using a xor algorithm
that only alters the data to decrypt it with the right decryption key. This guarantees that the
data remains unreadable and protected even if unauthorised persons get access to the encrypted
files. The patch will run as a single process. The patch will produce a file on a USB stick holding
the encryption key and another listing all previously encrypted file locations. The sticky bit
will be set to 1 to identify an encrypted file; only the file owners will have read and write rights.
When the computer is suspended, the patch protects the files and restores all data when the
machine is restarted. The file will not be decrypted if the USB is not inserted into the computer
during the decryption. Furthermore, depending on the user’s choices during configuration, the
programme can encrypt and decrypt data without waiting for the computer to restart.

3 Design Overview
This section describes the design of a software/patch that implements XOR encryption in Minix,
using system calls such as open, write, close, and signal. The XOR encryption software/patch
for Minix consists of the following components:
1. User Interface: This component provides an interface for users to input plaintext files and
encryption keys and to specify output file paths. The patch can only be run from the
terminal.
2. XOR Encryption Module: This component implements the XOR encryption logic using
C language. It reads the plaintext file and the encryption key, performs a bitwise XOR
operation, and writes the ciphertext to the output file. It utilises system calls such as
open, writes, and close to interact with the MInix file system for file I/O operations.
3. Key and file management: The key is stored and retrieved from the USB stick.

4. Signal Handling Module: This component handles signals, such as SIGCONT (continue
signal), to continue the execution of the program after the resuming process. It utilises sig-
nal system calls such as pause() to suspend the thread until a signal is received pause(3p).
When a thread is suspended until a signal is received, it can quickly respond to the signal
as soon as it is received without wasting CPU cycles on continuous polling or busy-waiting
5. Process and thread: The design will be a single process and thread
3.1 Usage
The XOR encryption software/patch can be used as follows:
1. The user inserts the path of the USB stick
2. User sets the encryption key if it’s not detected
3. User provides the number of files he wants to encrypt. 0 means that the users want only
to decrypt the files
4. Initiates the encryption process.
5. The XOR encryption module reads the plaintext file, performs XOR encryption with the
encryption key and writes the ciphertext to the output file using system calls such as
open, write, and close.
6. The signal handling module monitors for signals, such as SIGINT, and gracefully termi-
nates the encryption process when a signal is received using system calls.
7. The error handling and logging component captures and handles errors that may occur
during the encryption process, using system calls such as perror and syslog, and provides
appropriate feedback to the user through the user interface.
8. Once the encryption process is complete, the user can access the encrypted file at the
specified output file path.
3.2 Communications with the OS
This section will explain how the patch communicates with the Os. The patch is resident in the
user space but needs to communicate with the OS and the other system sublayer, as illustrated
in the image [1]. The patch communicates with the Os using the system calls. The following
list is a brief explanation of how communications work.
1. The user program initiates a system call by calling a library function, which maps the
system call to a specific function and passes the parameters to the kernel.
2. The kernel receives the system call request and checks the request’s validity. Additionally,
if the request is valid, the kernel locates the appropriate system call handler and passes
the request to it
3. The system call handler runs the request and interacts with all the hardware required.
When the operation is finished, it will return the result of the operation.
4. The user program receives the result or an error number.

5 Testing Plan
5.1 Test Case 1: Encrypt and Decrypt a Small Text File
Input:
• A small text file containing plain text data
• A generated encryption key set by the user
Steps:
1. Encrypt the text file using XOR with the provided encryption key
2. Verify that the encrypted file is created and saved in the file on the USB stick
3. Decrypt the encrypted file using XOR with the same encryption key
4. Verify that the decrypted file has the same content as the original plain text file
Expected Outcome: The encrypted file should be the same file with all the chars encrypted.
5.2 Test Case 2: Encrypt and Decrypt a Large Binary File
Input:
• A sizeable binary file (e.g., image, video, etc.) containing binary data
• A generated encryption key set by the user
Steps:
1. Encrypt the binary file using XOR with the provided encryption key
2. Verify that the encrypted file is created and saved in the file on the USB stick
3. Decrypt the encrypted file using XOR with the same encryption key, retrieving all the file
paths from the USB stick.
4. Verify that the decrypted file is created and has the same content as the original binary
file
5.3 Test Case 3: Encrypt and Decrypt only if the USB is plugged and
a SIGCONT signal is received
Input:
• USB stick path
• multiple files with a different extension
• A generated encryption key set by the user
Steps:
1. Generates the key and saves it in a file on the USB stick called key.txt
3
2. Set all the paths of the files we want to encrypt.
3. Check the permission of the files,
4. Encrypt the files one at a time and set the sticky bit to 1 using the encryption key
5. Append the file’s path in a file in the USB called ”files.txt” to keep track of the files
encrypted
6. Waiting for SIGCONT signal
7. When the signal is received, decrypt the encrypted file using XOR with the same encryp-
tion key, retrieving all the file paths from the USB stick.
8. Set the sticky bit to 0 to let the programs understand that the files are not encrypted.
9. Verify that the decrypted file is created and has the same content as the original binary
file
6 Description of integrating/adding the implemented com-
ponent/patch to OS
The component will not modify the OS but will implement the functionality using the existing
system call. The patch is a simple program situated in the /bin folder. The program is situated
here in order to allow the user to run the script from each location in the entire file system. All
the commands to compile and run the program will show up in the following list
1. compile the program ” gcc -o patch.o patch.c ”
2. move the executable ”mv patch.o /bin”
3. run the program ”./patch.o ”
7 Performance test
The performance of the patch is being tested using the time commands in the terminal followed
by the script name. The result is illustrated in the picture 2. This picture illustrated the CPU
time spent in user and system or kernel modes. It’s easy to understand that more files encrypted
and decrypted mean more CPU time spent. A different architecture as a multi-process, could
potentially reduce this time, but other different problems can occur, such as concurrency on
the file or potentially high intensive tasks if a process takes a long time to finish.
